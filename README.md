# task_killer
A task killer app that works on both Windows and Linux written in C language.
Please compile it under your OS environment. For Windows I used GCC C Compiler with command line option of -std=c99 to ensure there are no errors in complilation.

Not yet tested under Linux. Will update the readme once testing is complete.
